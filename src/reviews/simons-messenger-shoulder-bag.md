A joyful little bag that gives you a little bounce to your step.

Putting on the bag made me feel like I was 15 again, walking to school knowing that I had all my books and pencils in my messenger bag.

There's enough space for a laptop and some lunch, for example; loose salad with salad cream (which is what I believe Simon has been doing as there was a white stain in the bottom of the bag).

I would rate this bag slightly higher but I was told it didn't look nice on me because it had "too many colors".
