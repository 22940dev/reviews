It's basically a Top Gear episode but with the added excitement of James May potentially being flung out of a car.

Wreckfest is fun, exciting, and will appeal to racing game fans. However, I am not a racing game fan.

So when it switched from a battle royale on a tractor, to "here's a track, drive around it 3 times and try to win" I lost interest.

It's also hard to keep the momentum of excitement between games because the load times are SO long. I am fully aware that it's platform-dependent, and on PC I'm sure this issue would not exist but I'm not on PC, I'm on an Xbox and the load times suck.

As a developer, I know that there are platforms, in my case, web platforms, that are truly painful to work with, but the Xbox One isn't old and Wreckfest came out a year after the Xbox One released.

Therefore, SURELY this game was built with the current generation of consoles in mind, because HOW would they know about the Xbox Series X 6 YEARS before its release? ðŸ¤”
