Do you want to write easy to read, clean code that's production ready? Write Ruby on Rails.

It's easy to do a lot with not a lot of effort with Ruby on Rails and have a scalable code base once you're finished.

There's plenty of platforms out there that make Ruby on Rails development easier; Heroku has been the best one in my experience.

As for community, it's good. People can be very helpful and there's a lot of resources available to learn from. Even outdated resources like RailsCasts which hasn't been updated in years still have content that you can learn from. Which I think speaks wonders about how well Ruby on Rails has aged.

There's a lot of talk about Ruby on Rails being dead. I disagree. There's a lot of big websites out there that use Ruby on Rails:

* GitHub
* GitLab
* Shopify
* Basecamp
* HEY

And many more.

It was the go-to for startups and has remained one of the best options for startup companies, like Airbnb, albeit Airbnb has started to move away from Ruby on Rails.

People see that as a bad thing, they use it as a "Rails must be dead because Airbnb dropped it" but look at what Ruby on Rails did for Airbnb.

I use Ruby on Rails nearly every day, it's connected a lot of the dots I had about web development when I first started out and I'm sure it will do the same for you, just give it a chance.
