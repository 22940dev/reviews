I'm not a big fan of doughnuts, if it was up to me then you'd have a ball of dough with sugar and the filling on the side. It would be a dipnut.

However, these surprised me.

In typical doughnut fashion, there wasn't enough filling (a problem dipnut would solve).

The filling tasted like chocolate orange so that's that, the dough was very fluffy and the sugar was powdered my preferred sugar delivery method.

They're 100% worth a try, especially while they're 10p per doughnut.
