There's no definite number of hours I have spent playing this game, if I was to take a guess it would be 2000 to 3000 hours across Xbox 360, PC and the Xbox One.

That sentence alone should be enough of a review, but I can't leave it there.

This was the first game I started creating YouTube videos for and it's what I ended my channel with. It had so much content and such an active, intelligent community that everyday you'd learn something new.

The peak of Borderlands 2 was on PC, I had easy access to [Gibbed](https://github.com/gibbed/Gibbed.Borderlands2), recording equipment and the absolutely incredible [Community Patch](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Community%20Patch%20Team).

The community patch for Borderlands 2 re-energized the game and during this time I was averaging 500 thousand views a month on YouTube!

I even dabbled with weapon and class mod creation.

It's a perfect game that I only found when I broke my arm playing football and my mum asked "what are you gonna do for 6 weeks off school?" well mum, I played Borderlands 2 and no, it was not a game I could play one handed.

Word of advide to anyone who has never played Borderlands 2 and reads this, play Salvador.
