This show takes a total of 4 days and 3 hours to watch and I have now done that 4 times, meaning I have spent 16 days and 12 hours watching The Office (US).

The show is near perfect but it's downfall happens after Michael Scott, played by the man who plays Evan Almights, leaves, the show takes a season to figure out where it wants to go and throws too many story lines at the wall in an attempt to find out what sticks.

Also, Andy Bernard is an awful character that is designed for you to dislike, don't fall in the trap of hating the show because you hate him... Everyone hates him.
