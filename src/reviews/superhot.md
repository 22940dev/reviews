SUPERHOT is incredible. Just play it. It's like Â£15.

The mechanics are so simple but SO smart.

In short, time only moves when you move. Therefore you have these incredible flexible battles that you are in complete control of.

With SUPERHOT if you suck, it's your fault but you will get better. I was AWFUL when I first started as I was charging through trying to only use guns.

But NO.

You need to slow things down and work with the environment.

An example could be;

* Shoot an enemy
* Pick up their shotgun (while it's falling)
* Throw it at another enemy charging you
* Pick up their bat (while it's falling again)
* Hit another enemy with that
* Pick up the shotgun (still falling)
* Shoot the second enemy

And then whatever you want to do.

You can do all this at your pace because you control the game, it's incredible.
