This is a perfect TV show.

It has the comedy that is the day-to-day life of paper salesmen, but on top of that you have David Brent attempting to be a rockstar, a storyline later expanded on in the Christmas Special and the movie, David Brent: Life on the Road.

It's different from The Office (US) in that you are more laughing at the main character, rather than with them.

Also, you will get a live performance of "Freelove Freeway", the song from the Freeview advert as that is in fact song by Ricky Gervais.
