I have built many websites with Gridsome, it's by far the best experience I've had when I need to create a static website quickly, that is scalable and production ready.

There's a range of plugins available that make some complex processes easy, such as; using markdown files for static site generation (SSG), turning your website into a progressive web app (PWA), implementing search engine optimization (SEO) improvements and much more.

This website itself took about 5 minutes to setup, admittedly I copied some of the code from an existing Gridsome project I had built ([my personal website](https://mead.im/)), but that didn't make much of an impact.

I highly recommend you check out [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) for your next project.
