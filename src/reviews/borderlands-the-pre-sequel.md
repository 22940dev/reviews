Gearbox Software and 2K Games got quite a bit of stick on the release of Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, fans complained about; 

* Duplicate content from Borderlands 2
* Lack of gear farming
* Lack of content within the DLC's
* Lack of boss fights

and much more.

**But I LIKE Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel.**

I have way over 2000 hours on Borderlands 2 so yeah, the duplicated content in Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel does bother me. It's not enjoyable to have a legendary drop and it is a renamed version of loot in Borderlands 2.

The gear farming isn't great, there's a lot of loot drops unassociated to bosses and are instead random drops, or found through the stupid "Grinder" ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Swing and miss Gearbox.

The DLC for Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel shines in three places;

* Aurelia (character)
* Handsome Jack (character)
* Claptastic Voyage (story and loot)

There's also a huge lack of boss fights; the main one people farm is Iwajira and he is extremely boring. _If you can't find Iwajira, he is hidden in Serenity's Waste._

All of this sounds bad, but Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel has the magic of fun, fast-paced gameplay that varies on each map.

Pick it up as the Handsome Collection, it's worth the purchase and you'll get the best Borderlands DLC created... Handsome Jack.
