I don't like baggy jeans and I'm not talking about the stupid ones you see damaged artists wear, I'm talking about your basic Jeremy Clarkson jeans.

They're uncomfortable if I'm wearing them and uncomfortable if I have to look at someone wearing them.

There's no pressure to go the complete opposite and wear jeans so tight you can't hide your junk, but somewhere in between.

Do you know the worst thing about baggy jeans? When they get wet.

You have this horrible, flappy, wet thing hitting your leg over and over again. It's like getting wet jumper sleeves but you can't just take off your jeans, NO. You wore them, you have to suffer.
