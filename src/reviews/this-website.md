If we ignore the design briefly and talk functionality then yes, this website is OK.

It's a static site created with [Gridsome](/gridsome "Gridsome review"), Tailwind, Cloudinary and it uses Forestry as a CMS. 

* Gridsome is Gatsby but for Vue websites.
* Tailwind is CSS but you don't have to write CSS
* Cloudinary is used because hosting images on GitHub wasn't working
* Forestry is a Git driven CMS and is perfect for SSG (Static Site Generation)

**That's all great, but the design is awful.**

* It uses Comic Sans which only loads on desktop
* It's barely responsive
* There's a marquee, an HTML element that is so bad that HTML disowned it
* The website looks like it's given up before being given a chance

Will I change the design? Probably, but I can't be bothered right now.
