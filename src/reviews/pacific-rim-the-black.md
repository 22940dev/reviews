Apparently, this is an "anime", I did not know this so don't start thinking I'm a weeb.

This was my first experience with Pacific Rim and I'm not entirely sure I've missed out, it's just Godzilla-Esque-Lizards fighting robots, right? That being said, I did enjoy it.

There's a semi-decent story about two kids whose parents leave them to fight Godzilla, but years on these two kids find Optimus Prime who is their key to finding their parents.

The action is OK, it's nothing to get excited about.

Visually it's OK, there's a lot of sharp jawlines I'd usually say is quite unrealistic but giving all that else is going on, I'll let that slide.

It's definitely worth a watch if you have 20 minutes to kill and want to watch something that doesn't require much attention span.
