In this movie you see the Rock try something he hasn't done in a while; be a muscled-up character that uses his strength to scare and lead people.

I've not seen him play this role since;

* Moana
* Rampage
* Jumani
* Fast and Furious
* Skyscraper
* Fighting with My Family (probably)
* Hercules
* And so on...

There's also Troy Bolton who has given up his dream of basketball and is now a swimmer, convenient for his new role as a lifeguard.

The movie isn't without its funny moments, of which there are 2.

Alexandra Daddario is, as always, incredible.
