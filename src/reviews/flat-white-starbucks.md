I would have been much harsher on this review if I had made this website 6 months ago, but it seems as of recent that Starbucks has increased the size of their flat white.

It's now a normal size and still has all the flavor.

The thing I like most about a Starbucks Flat White though is the price. It's by far one of the cheapest options on the menu and you look cool because you're drinking Starbucks.

Also, coffee is coffee and once you start offering to drop some flavor pumps in my coffee I will refuse.
