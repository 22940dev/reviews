I was introduced to KISS when I watched the movie "Role Models", something I plan to review and spoilers, it's 5 STARS.

There was a quote;

> \[Kiss's "Love Gun" plays on the stereo\]   
>   
> You see, Ronnie, his **dick** is the gun!

I was interested.

I couldn't tell you who is in the band. I couldn't name 5 of their songs.

But when Love Gun, Detroit Rock City, I Was Made for Loving You, Rock and Roll All Nite, or Crazy Crazy Nights plays, I know it's them and it's enjoyed.

However, in reference to the movie "Role Models" I am very much a Danny (Paul Rudd);

> No, I like to rock n' roll all night and **part** of every day. I usually have errands... I can only rock from like 1-3.
