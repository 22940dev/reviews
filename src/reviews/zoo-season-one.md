This is awful.

I watched the whole thing, I 100% was into it but it was bad.

There are important parts of the show that the writers must have forgotten about, or didn't have the capacity to work on as they were too busy writing worse ideas.

The actors are OK, they're doing the best they can with what they've been given.

There's a huge missed opportunity here, the plot is an amazing one and in the right hands this could have been incredible.

I will be watching the next season being very comfortable with the idea of not finishing it, an attitude I have picked up from the writers of this terrible show.
