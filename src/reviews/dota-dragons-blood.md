What the fuck just happened?

I forgot that "Ending Explained" videos even existed, but I am VERY happy that they do because I had ZERO and I mean ZERO ideas of what the heck I just watched.

Disclaimer; I have never played DOTA, I've heard of it, and some of my friends have played it, but it's never been an interest to me. This has not changed because MOBA's are boring unless that MOBA is Gigantic or Battleborn.

_Gigantic and Battleborn aren't really MOBA's, more MOBA-like._

It's the second anime I have watched and I'm definitely seeing a pattern:

* chiseled jaws
* big titties

It's well worth the watch, I even binged it because I have nothing better to do, apparently.
